title: FMU Software Development Kit for version 2.0
content: >
  The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by
  QTronic to demonstrate basic use of Functional Mock-up Units
  (FMUs) as defined by the FMI Specification version 2.0 (July 25,
  2014) and 1.0. The FMU SDK can also serve as starting point for
  developing applications that export or import FMUs.

  The FMU SDK contains the C sources for various discrete and
  continuous FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zip'ing these
  models, an XML parser for parsing the model description of an
  FMU and a simple simulation program that runs a given FMU and
  outputs the result as CSV file.
