  The FMU Compliance Checker is a free software provided by the
  Modelica Association, implemented by Modelon AB to check a given
  FMU's compliance with the FMI standard. The FMU Compliance
  Checker relies on the FMI Library for loading and interacting with
  FMUs. A wide and increasing range of problems are checked for
  and reported to the user. This is an excellent tool for developers
  creating FMUs or creating FMU export functionality in their tool.
