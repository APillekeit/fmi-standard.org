title: FMI for Co-Simulation
content: >
  The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling two or more simulation tools in a co-simulation environment. The data exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication points. In the time between two communication points, the subsystems are solved independently from each other by their individual solver. Master algorithms control the data exchange between subsystems and the synchronization of all slave simulation solvers (slaves). All information about the slaves, which is relevant for the communication in the co-simulation environment is provided in a slave specific XML-file. In particular, this includes a set of capability flags to characterize the ability of the slave to support advanced master algorithms, e.g. the usage of variable communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation, or others.
