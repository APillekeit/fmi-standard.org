title: What and in which order should I read/do to get started with FMI technology?
content: >
  That depends mostly on your background knowledge. We assume here you already have fundamental knowledge of simulation technology (ODE vs. DAE, zero-crossing, state/time events, derivatives etc.):


  + First make a quick pass trough the [standard document](https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v2.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_and_CoSimulation_v2.0.pdf).

  + Then browse and play with the [available 3rd party development toolkits](https://fmi-standard.org/downloads#3rdparty).

  + Read the implementation hints contained in [FMI_for_ModelExchange_v1.0.zip](https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v1.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_v1.0.zip) - not yet available for FMI 2.0.

  + Re-read the standard document in detail.
