title: Who we are and what we do
content: >
  We are a group of companies, institutes and universities organized under the umbrella of the
  **Modelica Association Project [Function Mock-up Interface](https://www.modelica.org/projects)**.


  We are defining an open standard called **Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)**. This standard will improve and simplify the exchange of dynamic system models between different modelling, simulation and co-simulation tools. Applications range from software/model/hardware-in-the-loop simulation to embedded systems.
