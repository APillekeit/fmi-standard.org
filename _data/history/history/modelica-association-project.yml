title: Modelica Association Project
content: >
  To continue the cooperation of the FMI development partners beyond MODELISAR, the core development partners decided to find a new home for their activities under the roof of the Modelica Association. According to the Bylaws of the Modelica Association, a new [Modelica Association Project](https://modelica.org/projects) "Functional Mock-up Interface" was created.


  **Purpose**


  Development, standardization and promoting the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) definition, one result of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR. The intention is that dynamic system models of different software systems can be used together for software/model/hardware-in-the-loop simulation, for cyber physical systems, and other applications.
