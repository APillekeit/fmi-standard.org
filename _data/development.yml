      - title: Collaboration
        content: >
          The FMI group has a mailing list for email based discussions and holds frequent teleconferences to discuss the technical evolution of the
          standard. In addition, there are often FMI tracks at other FMI related events like conferences and design meetings.
          Development of the FMI standard is centrally managed at the [FMI Trac Site](https://trac.fmi-standard.org). This site is used to keep track of open issues with the current
          specification and proposals for future versions.
          If you believe you could benefit from the standard or if you would like to contribute to the improvement or distribution of it, please contact
          us at: [contact@fmi-standard.org](mailto:https://trac.fmi-standard.org).
