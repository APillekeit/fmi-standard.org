            Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to
            support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models
            using a combination of xml-files and compiled C-code (see overview in
            PDF or PPT format).
            The first version, FMI 1.0, was published in 2010, followed by FMI 2.0
            in July 2014. The FMI development was initiated by Daimler AG with
            the goal to improve the exchange of simulation models between suppliers
            and OEMs. As of today, development of the standard continues
            through the participation of 16 companies and research institutes. FMI
            is supported by over 35 tools and is used by automotive and non-automotive
            organizations throughout Europe, Asia and North America.
            On the Downloads page, the official standard texts are provided, as
            well as supporting C-header and xml schema files, and an FMI compliance
            checker. In addition, sample models (exported from different
            tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility
            with other tools. Contact the FMI development group at .
