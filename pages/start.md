Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to
support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models
using a combination of xml-files and compiled C-code (see overview in
[PDF]() or [PPT]() format).
The first version, [FMI 1.0](), was published in 2010, followed by [FMI 2.0]()
in July 2014. The FMI development was initiated by Daimler AG with
the goal to improve the exchange of simulation models between suppliers
and OEMs. As of today, development of the standard continues
through the participation of [16 companies and research institutes](). FMI
is supported by [over 35 tools]() and is used by automotive and non-automotive
organizations throughout Europe, Asia and North America.
On the [Downloads]() page, the official standard texts are provided, as
well as supporting C-header and xml schema files, and an FMI compliance
checker. In addition, sample models (exported from different
tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility
with other tools. Contact the FMI development group at .
