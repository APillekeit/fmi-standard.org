            This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement
            compared to FMI 1.0, where the
            FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements have been
            incorporated, often due to
            practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features include: Parameters can be changed
            during simulation, the complete
            FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized, directional derivatives with respect to states and
            inputs
            can be computed, the
            structure of the partial derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large
            systems), algebraic loops over FMUs
            are now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for
            example improved initialization.

                The intention is that a modelling environment can generate C-Code
                of a dynamic system model that can be utilized by other modelling
                and simulation environments. Models are described by differential,
                algebraic and discrete equations with time-, state- and step-events.
                The models to be treated by this interface can be large for usage in
                offline or online simulation or can be used in embedded control
                systems on micro-processors. It is possible to utilize several
                instances of a model and to connect models hierarchically together.
                A model is independent of the target simulator because it does not
                use a simulator specific header file as in other approaches. A model
                is distributed in one zip-file called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).

                The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling two or
                more simulation tools in a co-simulation environment. The data
                exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication
                points. In the time between two communication points, the
                subsystems are solved independently from each other by their
                individual solver. Master algorithms control the data exchange
                between subsystems and the synchronization of all slave simulation
                solvers (slaves). All information about the slaves, which is
                relevant for the communication in the co-simulation environment is
                provided in a slave specific XML-file. In particular, this includes a
                set of capability flags to characterize the ability of the slave to
                support advanced master algorithms, e.g. the usage of variable
                communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation, or
                others.
