Especially, a member has either to provide the FMI standard or part of it in a commercial or open source tool, and/or actively use FMI in industrial projects. Advisory Committee: The advisory committee contributes to the design of FMI. It consists of organizational members that have no voting rights but access to internal resources.'

    - title: Collaboration
      content: >
        The FMI group has a mailing list for email based discussions and holds frequent teleconferences to discuss the technical evolution of the
        standard. In addition, there are often FMI tracks at other FMI related events like conferences and design meetings.
        Development of the FMI standard is centrally managed at the [FMI Trac Site](https://trac.fmi-standard.org). This site is used to keep track of open issues with the current
        specification and proposals for future versions.
        If you believe you could benefit from the standard or if you would like to contribute to the improvement or distribution of it, please contact
        us at: [contact@fmi-standard.org](mailto:https://trac.fmi-standard.org).
