title: FMI for PLM
content: >
  FMI for PLM was developed as part of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR. The intention is to provide a generic way to handle all FMI related data needed in a simulation of systems in a "Product Lifecycle Management" system.


  This includes:


  * Functional Mock-up Units data needed for: edition, documentation, simulation, validation


  * Co-simulation data needed for: edition, simulation, and results management.


  * Result valuation data needed for: post-processing, analysis, report


  Generic processes are defined here, as well as a format description to communicate between the PLM system and the authoring tools.

version: Version 1.0 was released on Mar. 31, 2011.
