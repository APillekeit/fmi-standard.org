title: How is FMI related to Modelica?
content: >


  + Technically FMI is not related to Modelica, and can be seen as a complementary technology.

  + The intention of the FMI project is to be neutral with respect to tools, technologies (e.g. solvers, OS, files, systems...) and languages (including Modelica).

  + The FMI standard is developed as a Modelica Association Project within the Modelica Association, an organization focused on the "coordinated standardization and development of software technology and methods in the area of cyber physical- systems and systems engineering", see the Modelica Association Bylaws and the History page
