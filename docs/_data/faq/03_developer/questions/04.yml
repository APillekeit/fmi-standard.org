title: I added my test FMUs/Cross-Check results but the tools page does not show "green". Why?
content: >
  The Cross-Check Rules list a number of conditions before turning an entry "green". In short:


  + Exporting tools must provide at least 3 FMUs and at least one importer must report successful import.

  + Importing tools must report (and prove) successful import of at least 3 FMUs of at least 3 exporting tools.


  Please refer to the complete set of [rules](https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/CrossCheck_Results/FMI_Cross_Check_Rules_v3_2014_07_31.pdf) and [notes](https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/CrossCheck_Results/FMI_Cross_Check_Implementation_Notes_v3_2014_07_31.pdf).
