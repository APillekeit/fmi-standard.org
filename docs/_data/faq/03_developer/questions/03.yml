title: Does FMI 2.0 support Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)?
content: >
  There are two kinds of FMI variants: Model Exchange and Co-Simulation.


  Model-Exchange FMUs encode ODEs. PDE-support is not planned yet, but the demand for it is increasing.


  The second kind, Co-Simulation FMUs, can contain any kind of simulation component because it does not expose states. So as long as you want to simply encapsulate PDEs, this could be done.


  But explicitly exposing a PDE to a solver using FMUs is currently not supported.
