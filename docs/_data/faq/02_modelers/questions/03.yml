title: Where can I get help when I have problems related to FMI in my simulation tool?
content: >


  + Typically an exporting and an importing tool are involved in FMI-based simulation. So if problems occur and if it is not obvious which tool causes the problem, you should communicate the problem to the support team of both involved tools

  + As a general discussion forum about FMI, you may use the FMI forum on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/fmi)
