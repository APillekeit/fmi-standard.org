  FMI Library (FMIL), provided by Modelon, is a software package
  written in C that enables integration of Functional Mock-up Units
  (FMUs)
  import in applications. FMI Library is an independent open-source
  (BSD) implementation of the FMI open standard. The library
  provides a comprehensive C API for interacting with all parts of
  FMUs, including unzipping, loading of shared object files (DLLs)
  contained in FMUs, as well as parsing of XML model metadata files.
  FMI Library provides a proven and complete platform for developing
  FMI enabled applications and gives access to the technology used
  in several industrial FMI tools including the FMI Compliance Checker.
  FMIL support FMI for Model Exchange 1.0, FMI For Co-simulation
  1.0 and FMI 2.0.
