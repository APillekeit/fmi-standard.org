title: FMI for Model Exchange
content: >
  The intention is that a modelling environment can generate C-Code of a dynamic system model that can be utilized by other modelling and simulation environments. Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time-, state- and step-events. The models to be treated by this interface can be large for usage in offline or online simulation or can be used in embedded control systems on micro-processors. It is possible to utilize several instances of a model and to connect models hierarchically together. A model is independent of the target simulator because it does not use a simulator specific header file as in other approaches. A model is distributed in one zip-file called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).
