title: ASAM XIL-MA
content: >
  At the beginning of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR (the project in which FMI was initially developed) it was planned to develop FMI for Applications. The intention was to specify an API for simulation tools that allows the access of model parameters, stimulations and simulation results and to control simulation experiments as well. The API was supposed to provide tool independent access to simulation computations for optimization tools, test management and workflow definition tools.


  The project group noticed the parallel work of the ASAM XIL standardization group. Thus, both groups came to the conclusion not to develop a parallel standard but to cooperate. The result of this cooperation is available as ASAM XIL-MA, which is a subset from ASAM XIL standard. It contains the model access port specification as well as necessary common functionality for a proper operation of the model access. XIL-MA is open to public and the documentation of the standard can be obtained from ASAM for free without membership.
