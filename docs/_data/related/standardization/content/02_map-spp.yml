title: MAP SSP
content: >
  In many applications there is the need to design, simulate and execute a network of components (simulation models, software, hardware etc.). In order to be able to do this tool independently and seamlessly, the purposes of the "System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design (SSP)" project are:


  + Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters to these components.

  + Define a standardized format for the connection structure for a network of components.

  + The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of development process (architecture definition, integration, simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).
